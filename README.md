## What This Is

`SKILL.md` is the agent's brain. When a user asks a coffee-related question, the agent loads this file and uses it to reason about:
- Green coffee sourcing and origin selection
- Roasting profile development and production planning
- Quality control via SCA cupping protocols
- Cafe operations and espresso dial-in
- Supply chain, import logistics, and contracting
- E-commerce strategy and subscription models
- Regulatory compliance (FDA, FSMA, import permits)

## Quick Start for Agents

The agent loads this skill automatically when coffee-related topics are detected. No manual activation needed.

For manual loading:
