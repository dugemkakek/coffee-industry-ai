| Indonesia | Sumatra, Java, Sulawesi, Flores | Typica, Catimor | Earthy, herbal, woody, full body |

#### Indonesian Origins

Indonesia is the world's fourth-largest coffee producer, unique for its dominant use of **Giling Basah (wet-hulling)** processing and its archipelago geography, which produces distinct regional flavor profiles across Sumatran, Javan, Sulawesi, Flores, Balinese, and Papuan origins.

##### Sumatra — Mandheling, Lintong, Gayo

**Key Regions:**
- **North Sumatra**: Mandheling (Lake Toba region), Lintong (Lintongnihuta highlands)
- **Aceh**: Gayo highlands around Banda Aceh, Lake Tawar

**Common Varieties:** Typica, Catimor (Ateng, Bergimus sub-variants), Tim Tim (Hybrid of Timor)

**Processing: Giling Basah (Wet-Hull)**

The defining process for Sumatran coffee. Steps:

1. **Cherry picking**: Ripe cherries harvested, pulped same day
2. **Fermentation**: Overnight in tanks, 12–24 hours
3. **Washing**: Rinsed with clean water to remove mucilage
4. **First Drying**: Beans dried to ~30–35% moisture content (1–3 days on raised beds or concrete patios)
5. **Wet-Hulling**: Hull removed mechanically while beans still moist — this is the defining step. Gives beans their characteristic blue-green "kulit ari" (pergamino remnant) appearance
6. **Second Drying**: Hulled beans dried again to ~12–13% export moisture

**Flavor Profile:** Earthy, cedar, herbal, dark chocolate, low acidity, syrupy body, "funky" low notes. The wet-hull process creates the distinctive Sumatran profile — heavy body, muted acidity, deep earthiness.

**FOB Pricing:** $2.50–$4.50/lb for specialty Mandheling/Gayo lots

**Harvest:**
- Main crop: October–March
- Fly crop: May–July (lower quality, smaller volume)

**Key Exporters/Contacts:** Counter Culture Coffee (Gayo), Sucafina Indonesia, Pacific Commodities

##### Java — Estate Coffee

**Key Regions:** East Java: Ijen plateau, Bondowoso, Jampit, Blawan, Tugosari estates; West Java: Pangalengan highlands

**History:** Dutch colonial estates from the 17th–19th century. Indonesia's oldest coffee-producing region with continuous estate tradition.

**Common Varieties:** Typica, Bourbon (older estates), Catimor (newer plantings)

**Processing:** Mostly washed on estate operations. Smaller farms may use natural or Giling Basah.

**Flavor Profile:** Full body, dark chocolate, earthy with spicy/herbal notes. Some lots have a distinctive "smoky" character from estate processing. Cleaner than Sumatra, moderate acidity.

**FOB Pricing:** $3.00–$6.00/lb for estate Java

**Harvest:** Main crop November–April

**Note:** Java estates are relatively large, corporate operations (PTPN group). Smaller farmer collectives also exist.

##### Sulawesi — Toraja, Kalosi, Mamasa

**Key Regions:** South Sulawesi: Tana Toraja highlands around Mount Latimojong; Mamasa: Western Sulawesi highlands; Kalosi: specialty market designation

**Common Varieties:** Typica, Catimor (smallholder-sourced Catimor in Toraja)

**Processing:** Mostly washed, with some Giling Basah. Increasingly honey process on specialty lots.

**Flavor Profile:** Complex, earthy but cleaner than Sumatra, dark fruit, long finish, slightly spicy. Toraja has notably more acidity than typical Indonesian coffee — the most "bright" of the major Indonesian origins.

**FOB Pricing:** $3.50–$6.00/lb

**Harvest:** Main crop May–October

**Sourcing Note:** Sulawesi coffee typically flows through collector/aggregator networks rather than direct estate relationships. Less direct traceability.

##### Flores — Bajawa, Manggarai, Ruteng

**Key Regions:** Central Nusa Tenggara: Bajawa volcano region, Manggarai, Ruteng. Isolated island geography with volcanic soils.

**Common Varieties:** Typica, local Typica lines. Relatively isolated means less disease pressure — older variety lines have survived.

**Processing:** Mostly washed, some Giling Basah.

**Flavor Profile:** Earthy, woody, hint of citrus, cleaner than Sumatra. Volcanic soil contributes distinct mineral notes. An emerging specialty origin.

**FOB Pricing:** $3.00–$5.00/lb

**Harvest:** June–December

**Note:** Emerging specialty origin. Limited exporter infrastructure — supply chains less developed.

##### Bali — Kintamani

**Key Region:** Kintamani highlands, Bangli district, Mount Agung volcanic slopes.

**Common Varieties:** Typica, Bourbon, Catimor (local variant called "Kintamani")

**Processing:** Primarily wet (traditional Balinese farming cooperatives).

**Flavor Profile:** Bright acidity for Indonesian coffee, citrus, tropical fruit, some herbal notes, cleaner than Sumatra. Among the most "origin-expressive" of Indonesian coffees.

**FOB Pricing:** $3.00–$5.50/lb

**Harvest:** May–October

**Note:** Relatively small volume. Unique cultural context — Bali is Hindu in majority-Muslim Indonesia.

##### Papua — Baliem Valley

**Key Region:** Baliem Valley, Jayawijaya highlands, 1400–2000m elevation. Very remote.

**Common Varieties:** Improved Typica, local lines

**Processing:** Mostly Giling Basah, some washed.

**Flavor Profile:** Heavy body, earthy, low to mid acidity, wild forest notes.

**FOB Pricing:** $2.50–$4.00/lb

**Harvest:** April–September

**Note:** Very remote origin, limited exporter access. Political complexity around West Papua. Supply chain can be unreliable. Not a primary sourcing origin for most roasters.

##### Giling Basah (Wet-Hull) — Technical Deep Dive

**What Makes It Unique:** Hull is removed at high moisture content (typically 30–35%), whereas most coffee globally is hulled at 11–12% moisture after full drying.

**Why It Developed in Indonesia:** Indonesian climate is extremely humid, especially in Sumatra. Drying coffee to 11% in this humidity is difficult and slow. Wet-hulling allows farmers to dry to a safer intermediate moisture (~30–35%) and still process the bean to a storable, exportable state.

**The Result — Not a Defect:**
- Beans shrink and wrinkle during hulling at high moisture
- Characteristic "kulit ari" or pergamino remnant appearance on beans
- Color turns blue-green (not the brown of washed coffees)
- This is a defined process, not a defect — though poor execution creates defects

**Flavor Impact:** Creates the earthy, herbaceous, low-acid profile defining Sumatran/Mandheling style. Contributes to syrupy body. The "funky" bottom notes (earthy, herbal, cedar) are products of this process.

**Risks When Done Incorrectly:**
- Too much moisture at hulling → mold development, musty off-flavors
- Inconsistent fermentation → irregular flavor development
- "Potato defect" — rare in Indonesia but possible with poor handling

**When to Reject Indonesian Lots:**
- Strong musty/earthy smell beyond characteristic profile
- Visible mold on beans
- "Rubbery" off-flavor (improper fermentation)
- Very high moisture content on arrival (>13%)

##### Sourcing from Indonesia — Practical Notes

**Supplier Types:**

| Type | Examples | Pros | Cons |
|------|----------|------|------|
| Large exporters | Sucafina, Olam, ECOM | Easier logistics, consistent volume | Less traceability, commodity focus |
| Specialty-focused | Pacific Commodities, Vecmont | More traceability, quality focus | Smaller lots, higher minimums |
| Farmer cooperatives | Gayo Organic Coffee Cooperative, KNT | Direct, highland, excellent quality | MOQ challenging, lead time |
| Collectors/aggregators | Various Sulawesi networks | Accessible for remote origins | Less traceability, variable quality |

**MOQ:** Typically 1–5 × 60kg bags for specialty micro-lots. Exporters often ship 1-bag samples for quality approval.

**Logistics:** Primary ports: Surabaya, Semarang (Java). Transit to US East Coast: ~4–6 weeks. Transshipment through Singapore often required.

**Certifications:** Organic (USDA, EU), Rainforest Alliance, UTZ, Fair Trade exist but less common for smallholder lots. Verify per-lot — do not assume based on origin.

**Cupping Notes — What to Look For:**

| Note | Quality Implication |
|------|---------------------|
| Earthy, herbal, cedar | Characteristic of good Indonesian; desirable |
| Tobacco | Acceptable, especially in Java |
| Dark chocolate | Desirable, indicates proper development |
| Musty, moldy | REJECT — processing/storage problem |
| Rubber, chemical | REJECT — fermentation fault |
| Potato | REJECT — serious defect (rare in Indonesia) |

**Common Defects:** Water damage (humid storage), fermentation inconsistency, insect damage in field, immature beans from fly crop, hulling damage from wet-hull process if poorly executed.

**Regional Flavor Summary:**

| Origin | Body | Acidity | Key Notes | Best For |
|--------|------|---------|-----------|----------|
| Sumatra Mandheling/Gayo | Very Heavy | Low | Earthy, cedar, herbal, chocolate | Espresso blends, dark roasts |
| Java Estate | Full | Medium | Dark chocolate, smoky, earthy | Drip, espresso |
| Sulawesi Toraja | Full | Medium-High | Complex, dark fruit, spicy | Single origin pour-overs |
| Flores Bajawa | Medium-Full | Medium | Earthy, woody, citrus, mineral | Single origin, light roast |
| Bali Kintamani | Medium | Medium-High | Citrus, tropical fruit, clean | Bright pour-overs |
| Papua Baliem | Heavy | Low-Mid | Earthy, forest, wild | Blending, dark applications |

**Processing Methods:**

- **Washed (Wet)**: Fruit removed before drying. Clean, bright, consistent. High acidity, clarity of origin.
- **Natural (Dry)**: Coffee dried whole with fruit. Fruity, heavy body, complex. Can be inconsistent.
- **Honey**: Partial fruit removal leaving mucilage on bean during drying. Balance of clean and fruity. White honey (least) → Yellow → Red → Black (most mucilage retained).
- **Anaerobic**: Fermented in sealed tanks without oxygen. Intense, wine-like, distinct flavor development.
- **Carbonic Maceration**: Whole cherries in CO2 environment. Very fruity, floral, innovative.

**Variety Basics:**

- **Typica**: Original mutation, high quality, low yield, susceptible to disease
- **Bourbon**: French island variety, sweeter, more productive than Typica
- **Caturra**: Natural Bourbon mutation, compact, high quality
- **Catuaí**: Caturra × Mundo Novo hybrid, widely planted in Latin America
- **Castillo**: Colombian hybrid, disease resistant, acceptable quality
- **Heirloom**: Unidentified indigenous varieties (especially in Ethiopia, Yemen)
- **Geisha (Gesha)**: Panamanian variety renowned for extraordinary floral/tea-like character

**Sourcing Workflow:**

1. Define target flavor profile (acidity level, body, fruit intensity, finish)
2. Identify origins and processing methods that deliver that profile
3. Request samples (typically 250g–1kg micro-lots)
4. Conduct cupping evaluation (see Cupping Protocols)
5. Negotiate: FOB price, quantity, delivery schedule, processing specs
6. Confirm: place order, arrange shipping, track transit

**Typical Sample Lead Time:** 2–6 weeks from request to receipt.  
**Minimum Order Quantity (MOQ):** 10–60 bags (132lb/60kg each) for most importers.  
**Shipping Time:** 2–8 weeks by sea from origin to US/EU ports.

### 2. Coffee Roasting

**Roast Levels (Specialty Equivalents):**

| Name | Agtron Score | Development Time % | Flavor Character |
|------|-------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Light | 85+ | 20–25% | Origin-forward, high acidity, tea-like |
| Medium-Light | 75–85 | 22–26% | Balanced, fruit-forward, mild sweetness |
| Medium | 65–75 | 24–28% | Chocolate, caramel, moderate acidity |
| Medium-Dark | 55–65 | 26–30% | Dark chocolate, low acidity, bittersweet |
| Dark | 45–55 | 28–35% | Smoky, bitter, carbon, minimal origin |
| French/Italian | <45 | >35% | Burnt, ashy, heavy roasting character |

**Development Time % (DTR):** (Time after first crack ÷ total roast time) × 100

**Roast Curve Components:**

- **Charge temperature**: typically 350–400°F (177–204°C) for sample roasters, higher for production
- **Drying phase**: 150–200°F rise to first crack; removes moisture, develops color
- **Maillard reaction**: 280–340°F; sugars and amino acids react, brown color develops, flavor precursors form
- **First crack (FC)**: audible crack around 385–400°F (196–204°C); physical expansion releases CO2
- **Post-first crack development**: most flavor evolution happens here; determines roast character
- **Drop temperature**: typically 385–420°F (196–215°C)

**Roast Profiling Workflow:**

1. Collect green analysis (density, moisture %, screen size)
2. Set target: final color, DTR, charge temp based on experience with the coffee
3. Roast initial batches, cup each, record observations
4. Adjust: more development for body/sweetness, less for brightness/acidity
5. Repeat until target profile achieved
6. Document curve (time-temperature data) for reproducibility

**Roast Loss:** Typical weight loss 12–18% depending on density, moisture, and roast level.  
**Batch Size:** Production roasters range from 1kg (sample) to 120kg+ (industrial).  
**Roast Time:** 8–15 minutes for sample/small batch, 10–18 minutes for production.

### 3. Cupping Protocols (SCA Methodology)

**Standard Cupping Procedure:**

1. **Grind**: 8.25g coffee at setting 8 (SCA standard) per 150ml water
2. **Water**: Filtered, 200°F (93°C), freshly drawn
3. **Steep**: Pour all water at once, start timer, 4 minute steep
4. **Break crust**: At 4:00, break crust with spoon, push grounds back, skim foam
5. **Slurp**: At ~4:30, begin slurping from spoon to evaluate (loud slurp incorporates air)
6. **Score**: Evaluate at 5:00, 8:00, and 12:00+ minutes
7. **Rehydrate** (optional): Add hot water to dilute if too strong, re-evaluate

**SCA Scoring Scale (100-point):**

| Score | Quality Tier | Description |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| 90+ | Outstanding | Exceptional, rare, benchmark |
| 85–89.99 | Excellent | Special, complex, notable |
| 80–84.99 | Very Good | Quality, solid, no defect |
| <80 | Not Special | Below specialty threshold |

**SCA Cupping Form — Evaluate:**

- **Fragrance/Aroma**: Dry and wet aroma intensity and quality
- **Flavor**: Taste, weighted heavily; 15% of total score
- **Aftertaste**: Persistence of flavor after swallowing, weighted 15%
- **Acidity**: Brightness, liveliness; should match origin expectations
- **Body**: Texture, mouthfeel, weight (low → high)
- **Balance**: How elements integrate together
- **Uniformity**: Consistency across cups
- **Clean Cup**: Free of taints and faults
- **Sweetness**: Natural sweetness, absence of harshness
- **Overall**: Personal impression, overall preference

**Defects (SCAA Protocol):**

- **Category 1 defects** (3 per 350g = 0 defects allowed in specialty): Sour, fermented, chemical, rubbery, etc.
- **Category 2 defects** (8 category 1 + category 2 mixed = 0 allowed): Rough, papery, woody, stale, etc.
- Count defects, convert to score penalty using SCAA tables.

**Cupping Workflow:**

1. Prepare cupping table, label samples blind
2. Grind and evaluate fragrance
3. Pour water, note bloom and aroma
4. Break crust at 4:00, smell, skim
5. Begin slurping evaluation at 4:30
6. Score at intervals; note observations
7. Clean cup, taste again with water
8. Calculate score, compare samples

---

### 4. Cafe Operations

**Espresso Dial-In Process:**

1. **Grind setting**: Start at known baseline (finer for darker roasts)
2. **Dose**: 18–20g for double shot (adjust for basket size)
3. **Yield**: Target 36–40g out (1:2 ratio) for traditional; 40–50g for modern
4. **Time**: Target 25–35 seconds
5. **Adjust logic**:

   - Too fast → grind finer (more resistance)
   - Too slow → grind coarser (less resistance)
   - Sour (under-extracted) → increase dose or grind finer
   - Bitter (over-extracted) → decrease dose or grind coarser

**Ratio Reference:**

| Style | Dose (g) | Yield (g) | Ratio | Time (s) |
|-------|----------|-----------|-------|----------|
| Ristretto | 18 | 24–28 | 1:1.3–1:1.5 | 22–28 |
| Traditional | 18–20 | 36–40 | 1:2 | 25–35 |
| Lungo | 18–20 | 50–60 | 1:2.5–1:3 | 30–45 |
| Triple | 21–22 | 42–46 | 1:2 | 28–35 |

**Milk Texturing:**

- Use fresh, cold milk (any fat % works, but consistency matters)
- Steam wand tip just below surface, create vortex
- Texture until 140°F (60°C); avoid scalding
- Target: glossy, paint-like consistency; pours smoothly

**Workflow Optimization:**

- Group orders by drink type: all espresso first, milk drinks second, cold drinks third
- Pre-gram doses in holder if time allows
- Flush group between shots to maintain temperature
- Clean steam wand immediately after use

**Barista Training Fundamentals:**

- Hand placement, tamping pressure (30lbs, level)
- Distribution techniques (WDT, OCD, tap)
- Pressure profiling vs fixed pump
- Diagnosing extraction issues

- Safety stock = 2–4 weeks supply
- Reorder point = (lead time in weeks + safety weeks) × weekly consumption
- Ideal: 6–10 weeks of stock on hand at any time

---

### 6. Pricing & Contracts

**Coffee Pricing:**

- **C-market (ICE)**: Global benchmark, driven by supply/demand, speculation. Arabica futures in cents/lb.
- **Specialty premium**: Above C-market for quality, reflects scarcity, brand, relationships
- **Fixed price contracts**: Lock price at confirmation; buyer absorbs C-market risk
- **Floating price contracts**: Price tied to C-market at delivery; both parties share risk

**Price Structure Example (2024):**

| Component | $/lb |
|-----------|------|
| C-market base | $2.00–3.50 |
| Country premium | +$0.30–1.50 |
| Processing premium (washed/specialty) | +$0.20–2.00 |
| Relationship/floor | +$0.10–0.50 |
| **FOB delivered price** | **$2.60–7.50** |

### Indonesia Ops — WhatsApp & WooCommerce

This section covers the day-to-day operational layer for Indonesian coffee businesses running WhatsApp-based orders and WooCommerce as the storefront.

---

#### WhatsApp Order Parsing

WhatsApp is the primary order channel for many Indonesian coffee businesses. Agents must parse free-form messages in Bahasa Indonesia, English, or mixed-language.

**Common Order Patterns:**

| Pattern | Example | Parsed Intent |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| Direct product request | "Mau 2 bungkus Arabica Gayo" | 2 bags × Gayo |
| Subscription | "Mau langganan 1 bulan" | Subscribe × 1 month |
| Stock inquiry | "Ada kopi Flores?" | Query stock × Flores |
| Price request | "Harga Giling Basah berapa?" | Query price × Giling Basah |
| Reorder | "Sama kayak yang lalu" | Reorder × last order |
| Partial/ambiguous | "bisa kirim ke solo?" | Query × delivery × Solo |

**Intent Classification Output (JSON):**
```json
{
  "channel": "whatsapp",
  "customer_name": "string",
  "message_raw": "string",
  "intent": "order | inquiry | subscription | complaint | reorder | other",
  "items": [
    {
      "product": "string or null",
      "quantity": number,
      "unit": "bag | kg | box | month",
      "notes": "string or null"
    }
  ],
  "delivery_address": "string or null",
  "delivery_city": "string or null",
  "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
  "requires_human": false
}
```

**Bilingual Response Templates:**

*Order confirmation (Bahasa-dominant):*
> "Halo [Nama]! Order diterima ✅\n> [Qty] × [Produk]\n> Total: Rp[Harga]\n> Dikirim ke: [Alamat]\n> Estimasi kirim: [H+1 hingga H+3]\n> Mohon konfirmasi dengan reply 'OK' ya."

*Stock unavailable (mixed):*
> "Mohon maaf, [Produk] sedang kosong. Estimasi restock: [Tanggal]. Alternative lain: [Produk pengganti] — mau dicoba?"

*Subscription inquiry (English option):*
> "For our subscription plans: 1-month (4 deliveries), 3-month (12 deliveries), or 6-month (24 deliveries). Each delivery is 250g or 500g of your chosen coffee. We roast fresh per delivery. Shall I set up your subscription?"

**Escalation Rules — Route to Human When:**
- Complaint about quality or wrong order
- Order value > Rp 2,000,000 (suspiciously large)
- Request for Net 30/60 payment terms
- Delivery address is incomplete or unclear
- Customer explicitly asks for roaster/proprietor
- Same customer has 2+ complaints in 30 days

---

#### WooCommerce Integration

**Order Status Flow:**

```
Pending Payment → Processing → Shipped → Completed
                      ↓
                  On Hold (if inventory issue)
                      ↓
                  Cancelled (if unresolved)
```

**Store Ops Agent WooCommerce Tasks:**

1. **Check new orders** — Poll WooCommerce REST API (`/wp-json/wc/v3/orders`) for status = "pending" or "processing" every 15 minutes
2. **Update inventory** — After each order, decrement stock for ordered products. If stock drops below reorder threshold, trigger inventory alert.
3. **Mark shipped** — When fulfillment posts tracking number, update order status to "shipped" and add tracking note
4. **Handle payment failures** — Orders stuck at "pending" > 48h should be flagged for follow-up

**WooCommerce Stock Alert Format:**
```json
{
  "type": "inventory_alert",
  "product_name": "string",
  "sku": "string",
  "current_stock": number,
  "reorder_threshold": number,
  "status": "low_stock | out_of_stock",
  "action_required": "reorder | contact_supplier | none",
  "eta_if_reorder": "YYYY-MM-DD"
}
```

**Key WooCommerce API Endpoints (for agent use):**
- `GET /wp-json/wc/v3/orders?status=pending,processing` — new orders
- `PUT /wp-json/wc/v3/orders/{id}` — update order status
- `GET /wp-json/wc/v3/products` — product list with stock
- `PUT /wp-json/wc/v3/products/{id}` — update stock quantity

**WooCommerce + WhatsApp Sync Rule:**
When an order ships, send WhatsApp message to customer with tracking number. Template:
> "Halo [Nama]! Pesanan sudah dikirim 🚚\n> Tracking: [Nomor Resi]\n> Ekspedisi: [Jasa Kirim]\n> Estimasi sampai: [H+2 hingga H+5]\n> Lacak di: [Link Tracking]"

---

#### Order Fulfillment Checklist

For each outgoing order:

- [ ] Verify payment received (or confirm PayLater/transfer on hold)
- [ ] Check product stock is physically available (not just WooCommerce count)
- [ ] Roast fresh if roast-to-order model (note roast date on bag label)
- [ ] Package: nitrogen flush or valve bag, opaque bag, label with: product name, roast date, net weight, BPOM/halal logos if applicable
- [ ] Attach packing slip (order number, customer name, items)
- [ ] Drop at courier before cutoff time (typically 15:00 WIB for same-day pickup)
- [ ] Update WooCommerce order status to "shipped" with tracking number
- [ ] Send WhatsApp shipping notification to customer

---

#### Pricing in IDR — Costing Basics

For Indonesian operations, all pricing is in Rupiah (IDR). Agents working in WooCommerce must handle IDR correctly.

**Key numbers:**
- USD 1 ≈ IDR 16,000 (check current rate — this fluctuates)
- 60kg green coffee bag at $13/lb FOB = ~IDR 12,480,000 per bag (before shipping, duties, local transport)
- Cost per 250g retail bag (rough): (green coffee cost + roast loss + packaging + labor) × 2.2–2.5 markup = wholesale price
- Consumer price guide (approximate):
  - 250g homebrew single origin: IDR 75,000–150,000
  - 250g premium/competition: IDR 150,000–350,000
  - Espresso-based drinks at cafe: IDR 25,000–55,000

**Margin Check:** Target gross margin ≥ 50% for wholesale, ≥ 60% for DTC retail after accounting for green coffee, packaging, labor, and shipping.

---

### 8. Regulatory Compliance

**FDA Requirements (US):**

- **FSMA (Food Safety Modernization Act)**: Requires Hazard Analysis and Risk-Based Preventive Controls (HARPC) for food facilities
- **Prior Notice**: Must notify FDA before imported food arrives at port
- **Facility Registration**: Domestic facilities must register with FDA every 2 years
- **Labeling**: Ingredient list, allergen declarations, nutrition facts (if required), country of origin

**Import Permits:**

- Green coffee generally does not require specific import permits beyond customs entry
- Some countries require phytosanitary certificates from origin
- Organic certification requires USDA-accredited certifier

**Organic Coffee:**

- Must be certified by USDA-accredited agent
- Requires: organic system plan, field history (3 years no prohibited substances)
- Additional cost: $500–$5000+ annually depending on scale
- Price premium: typically $0.30–1.00/lb at green level

**Allergen Declarations:**

- Coffee is generally allergen-free
- Cross-contact risk: milk, flavorings, chocolate added post-roast
- List any added ingredients (flavored coffees, milk powders)

**Country of Origin Labeling (COOL):**

- Required for unpackaged coffee sold in the US
- "Product of [Country]" required if >50% of value is from that country
- For blends, origin of each component if marketed as origin-specific

**EU Regulations:**
- EU Food Information Regulations: allergen labeling, nutritional info
- Maximum residue levels (MRLs) for pesticides
- Organic certification must be EU-equivalent

### Indonesian Regulatory Compliance (BPOM, SNI, Halal)

**Overview:** Indonesia's coffee market is regulated by three main frameworks: BPOM (food safety/registration), SNI (national standards), and MUI (halal certification). A fourth area covers export/import procedures. Compliance requirements vary based on whether you are roasting, packing, importing, or exporting coffee.

---

#### 1. BPOM — Badan Pengawas Obat dan Makanan

**Role:** BPOM is Indonesia's food and beverage regulatory authority, equivalent to the US FDA. All food products sold commercially in Indonesia must be registered with BPOM and carry a distribution number (ML — Nomor Lisensi) on packaging.

**Coffee Products Requiring BPOM Registration:**
- Green coffee beans (biji kopi hijau)
- Roasted coffee beans (kopi sangrai)
- Ground roasted coffee (kopi bubuk)
- Instant coffee (kopi instan)
- Ready-to-drink (RTD) coffee beverages

**BPOM Number Format:**
Format: `AI 12345678901` — 13 digits total (2-letter prefix + 11 digits). Must appear on all packaged coffee products sold in Indonesia.

**Application Process:**
1. Register company on OSS (Online Single Submission) portal (oss.go.id) to obtain NIB (Nomor Induk Berusaha — Business Identification Number)
2. Submit application via BPOM website (pom.go.id) with:
   - Company legal documents (NIB, business license)
   - Product formulation and details
   - Label design (must comply with BPOM labeling rules)
   - Test results from accredited laboratory (KAN-accredited labs)
3. BPOM review and inspection
4. Issuance of ML (distribution license) number

**Timeline:** 3–6 months for new registration. Emergency use of existing registered products (purchased from authorized distributor) can be faster.

**For Importers (e.g., Solo roaster importing green beans):**
- The importer must hold a BPOM-authorized import license
- The roaster buying from a registered importer does not always need their own BPOM number
- However, if the roaster brands and sells their own packaged product, they need their own BPOM ML number

**Key BPOM Standards for Coffee:**

| Parameter | Limit |
|-----------|-------|
| Green coffee max moisture | 12.5% |
| Roasted coffee max moisture | ≤5.0% (see SNI) |
| Aflatoxin B1 | ≤5 ppb |
| Aflatoxin total | ≤10 ppb |
| Lead | ≤0.1 mg/kg |
| Cadmium | ≤0.05 mg/kg |
| Total Viable Count (TVC) | ≤10^5 cfu/g |
| E. coli | Absent in 0.1g |
| Salmonella | Absent in 25g |

**Note on Cadmium:** Indonesian coffee often tests higher in cadmium due to volcanic soil. Roasters should source from suppliers who test and can provide documentation. This is a known issue for Toraja, Sulawesi, and some Java coffees.

**Key Contacts:**
- BPOM Head Office: Jakarta — pom.go.id
- Provincial/municipal offices in each province
- OSS portal for business licensing: oss.go.id

---

#### 2. SNI — Standar Nasional Indonesia (Indonesian National Standard)

**Standard:** SNI 01-3542:2019 — Indonesian National Standard for Roasted Coffee

**Scope:** Defines requirements for roasted coffee beans, ground roasted coffee, and instant coffee sold in Indonesia. Compliance is mandatory under Permentan 59/2018 (Ministry of Agriculture regulation making SNI mandatory for agricultural products).

**Key Requirements under SNI 01-3542:2019:**

| Parameter | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| Moisture content | ≤5.0% (weight basis) |
| Ash content | 3.0–6.0% for pure coffee (detects adulteration with starch, chicory, soybean, corn) |
| Caffeine content | Minimum 0.3% for pure roasted coffee (detects adulteration) |
| Extraneous matter | ≤0.1% by weight |
| Defect count | Maximum allowable defects per 300g sample (black, sour, insect-damaged, etc.) |
| Packaging | Food-grade, airtight, light-protective (foil laminate or opaque) |
| Net content | Must match labeled amount (random government inspections) |

**SNI Certification Process:**
1. Apply to BSN (Badan Standardisasi Nasional — National Standards Body)
2. Submit product for testing by KAN-accredited laboratory
3. Factory audit by BSN assessor
4. Certificate issuance (valid for variable period, typically 1–3 years)
5. Surveillance audits

**SNI Certification Costs (approximate):**
- Initial audit: IDR 15–30 million
- Annual maintenance fees: IDR 5–15 million
- Laboratory testing: IDR 2–10 million per product

**Practical Reality for Small Roasters:**
- SNI certification is expensive and burdensome for micro/small roasters
- Most small artisan roasters operate with understanding that enforcement targets large commercial players
- However, if selling through modern retail channels (Indomaret, Alfamart, supermarkets, e-commerce platforms like Tokopedia/Shopee), retailers typically require SNI compliance
- Small roasters selling direct-to-consumer (DTC) with no retail distribution often operate without SNI, though this carries some legal risk

**SNI Mark (Tanda SNI):** Diamond-shaped mark. Not required for small artisan roasters selling direct-to-consumer if not requested by customers or retailers.

---

#### 3. Halal Certification — MUI (Majelis Ulama Indonesia)

**Background:** Indonesia has the world's largest Muslim population (~87%). Halal certification is important for market access, particularly in modern retail and for Muslim consumers.

**Legal Framework:** Law No. 33/2014 on Halal Product Assurance mandates that all food, beverage, and consumer goods sold in Indonesia must be halal-certified by 2026 (phased implementation timeline).

**Coffee Products and Halal Status:**

| Product Type | Halal Requirement |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Pure roasted coffee beans (100% coffee, no additives) | Generally NOT required — coffee itself is not haram (forbidden). Some producers get a "halal-free" letter or self-declare. |
| Flavored coffee (vanilla, caramel, etc.) | Required — added ingredients trigger mandatory certification |
| Instant coffee with sugar/creamer | Required — multi-ingredient product |
| Coffee with milk powder/cream | Required |
| Coffee-based beverages (Latte, Cappuccino mixes) | Required |

**MUI Halal Certification Process:**
1. Apply to MUI Provincial or Central office with product formulation and full ingredients list
2. Submit sample to accredited laboratory for halal testing
3. Factory audit by MUI assessor team
4. MUI Fatwa Commission review
5. Halal certificate issued

**Timeline:** 3–6 months typically
**Cost:** IDR 5–20 million depending on product complexity
**Certificate Validity:** 2 years with annual surveillance audit

**For Pure Coffee Roasters:**
If you sell only 100% roasted coffee with no additives, no flavoring, no blending with milk/cream products, you may be able to:
- Obtain a "halal-free" letter from MUI (surat keterangan bebas halal)
- Self-declare (increasingly accepted for pure single-ingredient products)

**Halal Logo:** White diamond shape with Arabic script. Required on packaging for certified products. Some specialty roasters avoid displaying the halal logo as it may limit export flexibility to non-Muslim markets.

---

#### 4. Export from Indonesia

**Inter-Island Shipping (e.g., Sumatra to Java):**
- Phytosanitary Certificate (Sertifikat Kesehatan Karantina) from Indonesian Quarantine Agency (Barantin) required
- Must meet quality standards of destination province
- Mobile coffee quality declarations

**Export from Indonesia (International):**

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| Phytosanitary Certificate | Required; ISPM 15 compliance for wood packaging materials |
| Certificate of Origin | From Chamber of Commerce (Kadin) — required for most destinations |
| Fumigation | Methyl bromide treatment often required; heat treatment preferred (more environmentally friendly) |
| Documentation | Cupping report, SCA score documentation helpful for customs clearance in destination country |
| Export duty | 7% on green coffee (check current rates as subject to change) |

---

#### 5. Import into Indonesia

**For Roasters Importing Green Coffee:**
- **NPIK (Nomor Pengenal Importir Khusus):** Special Importer Identification Number — required for commercial importers
- **Import Declaration (SPP):** Submitted via INSW (Indonesia National Single Window) system
- **Quarantine clearance:** Must present phytosanitary certificate from country of origin
- **Import tariffs on green coffee:**
  - Import duty: 5%
  - VAT (PPN): 10%
  - Luxury goods tax (PPnBM): Not typically applied to green coffee
- **Coffee roasting machines:** 0% import duty under HS code 8479.20.00 (check specific machine classification); VAT still applies

---

#### 6. Food Safety — HACCP, GMP, and Licensing

**BPOM Requirements:**
- HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points) plan required for food businesses
- GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) certification recommended

**Basic Food Safety SOPs for Roasters:**
- Handwashing and personal hygiene
- Equipment sanitation schedules
- Pest control program
- Temperature and moisture monitoring
- Separate storage of green vs. roasted coffee
- Traceability records

**Licensing Tiers in Indonesia:**

| License Type | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| PIRT (Produk Industri Rumah Tangga) | For home/small-scale food businesses — not suitable for commercial roasters |
| MD (Marketing Authorization) | Product registration — number assigned to registered product |
| ML (Nomor Lisensi — Distribution License) | Facility license for distribution of registered product |
| NIB (Nomor Induk Berusaha) | Business identification number from OSS — required first step |

**Recommendation for Commercial Roasters:** Aim for MD/ML from BPOM rather than PIRT. NIB is the foundational business registration obtained through oss.go.id.

---

#### Quick Reference Summary

| Requirement | Mandatory? | Notes |
|-------------|------------|-------|
| BPOM ML number | Yes (for packaged product sales) | 3–6 months to obtain |
| SNI 01-3542:2019 | Yes (for roasted coffee) | Enforced for retail; relaxed for DTC artisan |
| Halal certification | Yes (if product contains non-coffee ingredients) | 3–6 months, IDR 5–20M |
| Phytosanitary (inter-island) | Yes | From Barantin |
| Phytosanitary (export) | Yes | ISPM 15 for wood packaging |
| HACCP plan | Yes (for food businesses) | Implement basic food safety SOPs |
| Import license (NPIK) | Yes (for importers) | For roasters importing directly |

## 9. AI Agents in the Coffee Supply Chain

*Research findings — AI Agents in the Coffee Supply Chain (May 31, 2026)*

### 9.1 Key Finding: No Unified AI Exists

**The coffee industry has no end-to-end AI agent connecting farm to cup.** Each stage — farming, grading, roasting, trading, logistics, retail — has fragmented point solutions that don't communicate. The biggest opportunity is building agentic AI systems that connect these stages with real-time data flowing between them.

### 9.2 AI Adoption by Stage

| Stage | AI Maturity | Key Technologies |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Farming** | Low | Precision ag, satellite/drone imaging, disease detection, yield prediction |
| **Grading/QC** | Medium-High | Computer vision sorting (Demetria, Te.A.works), NIR spectroscopy |
| **Roasting** | Medium | Automated roast profiling, predictive color tracking, blend optimization |
| **Trading** | High | Price forecasting, procurement optimization, arbitrage detection |
| **Logistics** | Medium | Route optimization, cold chain monitoring, blockchain traceability |
| **Retail** | High | Demand forecasting, dynamic pricing, personalization, inventory |

**Computer vision is the most mature AI technology** in coffee — defect sorting, disease detection, and color tracking are all commercially deployed.

### 9.3 Key Companies & Technologies

**Farming AI:**
- **Cropin** (India) — farm intelligence platform, satellite + IoT, commercial deployment at large plantations
- **PlantVillage Nuru** — free disease detection app deployed in East Africa, smartphone-based
- **World Coffee Research (WCR)** — AI for breeding disease-resistant varieties

**Grading AI:**
- **Demetria** (Colombia/USA) — NIR spectroscopy + ML for green coffee quality classification, partnered with Starbucks
- **Te.A.works** (Colombia) — optical sorting with AI at processing facilities
- **Singulator** (Australia) — AI cherry grading at farm level

**Roasting AI:**
- **Banana Rain** (USA) — AI roasting "Botz" system, machine learning roast optimization
- **Bellwether Coffee** (USA) — electric smart roasters, cloud-connected, sustainability focus
- **Cropster** — market leader in roast profiling software, 2000+ roasters, large dataset of roast profiles

**Trading AI:**
- **ECOM** (Switzerland) — major global trader, proprietary AI trading and risk management
- **Volcafe** — weather + crop analytics for trading intelligence
- ICO (International Coffee Organization) — market reports with ML insights

**Logistics AI:**
- **Farmer Connect** (IBM) — blockchain + AI, Starbucks using it, 400,000+ farmers connected
- **Bext360** — origin verification, blockchain traceability
- **Mosi** — cold chain monitoring, route optimization

**Retail AI:**
- **Luckin Coffee** (China) — AI-native retailer, 10,000+ stores, app-only ordering, demand prediction at scale
- **Nespresso** — AI subscription management, churn prediction
- **Starbucks Deep Brew** — personalized recommendations, demand forecasting

### 9.4 EU Sustainability Regulations — Key Driver

The **EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD)** is pushing large buyers (Nestlé, Starbucks, Lavazza) to verify sustainability claims at farm level. This is funding AI traceability tools that previously had no business case.

**Impact:** Mandatory supply chain due diligence = AI traceability becomes compliance requirement, not nice-to-have.

### 9.5 Gaps & Opportunities

**Gaps:**
- Smallholder farmers (~80% of global coffee) lack affordable AI tools — connectivity and cost barriers
- Electronic nose for flavor prediction — 3-5 years away from commercial reliability
- No end-to-end AI system connecting farm to cup
- Real-time quality tracking during shipping — sensor cost barriers

**Opportunities for Coffee Trading AI:**
1. **Coffee as macro signal** — The intelligence layer can ingest coffee commodity data (Arabica/Robusta prices, weather in origin countries, ICO reports) as a macro input for crypto trading. Coffee prices correlate with inflation and emerging market sentiment.

2. **Coffee trading via crypto exchanges** — Apply a trading AI decision engine framework to coffee futures. Start with Binance/Bybit coffee perpetual contracts for market data.

3. **Extending to coffee** — Existing macro + sentiment analysis capability can extend to coffee commodity research without new infrastructure.

**Build Opportunities:**
4. **Farm-to-cup data aggregation agent** — connects Cropin (farm data), Demetria (grading), Cropster (roasting), and logistics APIs. Gives roasters/traders real-time visibility across supply chain.

5. **Smallholder decision support agent** — mobile-first, works offline, harvest timing + disease alerts + market prices. On-device ML to handle connectivity gaps.

6. **Coffee price intelligence agent** — real-time monitoring of Arabica/Robusta prices, weather in origins, news. Buy/sell signals for physical traders and arbitrage across exchanges.

7. **Sustainability compliance agent** — tracks EU regulations, auto-generates required documentation from supply chain data.

### 9.6 Important Caveats

- **Fully autonomous roasting** — still requires human sensory validation. AI handles process control, not flavor judgment.
- **Disease detection accuracy** in varied field conditions — [UNVERIFIED]
- **Electronic nose** — 3-5 years away from commercial viability for coffee flavor prediction
- **Price forecasting models** — coffee price shocks from climate events (frost, drought) remain hard to predict. AI helps but human judgment on climate risk is still superior.
- **Blockchain traceability ≠ fair pricing** — farmers often still receive minimum prices even with full traceability. Tracing coffee doesn't automatically improve farmer livelihoods.

### 9.7 Source Quality

**Well-documented:** Cropin, Demetria, Farmer Connect, ECOM, Volcafe, Cropster, Luckin Coffee, Starbucks (earnings reports), SCA working groups.

**Growing/less data:** Mosi, EcoChain, Pecan Machine, Banana Rain (specialty press only), Xcafé (limited English documentation).

**Key industry voices:** James Hoffmann (World Barista Champion), SCA technical committees, World Coffee Research, ICO.

## Workflows

### Workflow 1: Sourcing a New Origin

**Objective:** Evaluate and source a new green coffee supplier.

**Steps:**

1. **Define targets**: What flavor profile? What price range? What volumes?
2. **Research**: Identify origins/regions producing desired profile. Ask importers for recommendations.
3. **Request samples**: Contact exporter/importer. Request 250g–1kg sample of target lots. Clarify: variety, processing, harvest date, farm/station name.
4. **Receive & prep**: Upon receipt, check: moisture (10–12%), screen size, defect count (visual), bag integrity.
5. **Cup**: Run SCA cupping protocol. Score blind. Note: fragrance, flavor, acidity, body, aftertaste, overall.
6. **Compare**: Score sheet vs. profile targets. Identify top performers.
7. **Request info**: For finalists, get: farm details, certifications, processing specs, export history.
8. **Negotiate**: Quote for 10–60 bags. Confirm: price (FOB/CIF), payment terms, lead time, sample approval clause.
9. **Contract**: Sign SPA. Confirm pre-ship sample approval required.
10. **Track**: Monitor production, shipping, arrival. Cup arrival sample against pre-ship sample.
11. **Approve or reject**: If arrival QC matches or exceeds sample, approve. If not, invoke contract clause.

**Tools:** Cupping forms (SCA template), supplier database (spreadsheet or Notion), sample tracking log.

### Workflow 2: Developing a Roast Profile

**Objective:** Create a roast curve to achieve target flavor from a given green coffee.

**Steps:**

1. **Green analysis**: Check moisture (10–12%), density (floating test or equipment), screen size distribution.
2. **Set target**: Based on origin and processing (e.g., washed Ethiopian → target high acidity, floral notes, light body).
3. **Initial roast**: Baseline charge temp, moderate DTR (22–24%). Cup, record observations.
4. **Evaluate**: Identify gaps between flavor and target.
5. **Adjust curve**:

   - Want more brightness? → Increase charge temp slightly, reduce DTR
   - Want more body/sweetness? → Extend DTR, slightly higher post-FC development
   - Want to preserve delicate florals? → Reduce overall heat application, shorten DTR
   - Want more chocolate/nutty? → Lower charge temp, extend DTR to medium roast level

6. **Second roast**: Apply adjustment. Cup.
7. **Iterate**: Repeat 2–3 batches until target achieved.
8. **Document**: Save curve data (time-temperature chart). Note: charge temp, roast time, DTR, drop temp, batch size.
9. **Validate**: Run same curve on different day with same green. Confirm reproducibility.
10. **Scale up**: Apply curve to production roaster (may need minor adjustment vs. sample roaster).

**Tools:** Roast profiling software (Artisan, Cropster, Roastlog), color meter (Agtron), spreadsheet for curve data.

### Workflow 3: Espresso Dial-In

**Objective:** Achieve target extraction parameters for a given coffee on a given machine.

**Steps:**

1. **Know your baseline**: Start from known grind setting for that roast level (finer for lighter, coarser for darker).
2. **Set dose**: 18–20g into double basket (verify basket size).
3. **Pull shot**: Note: extraction time, yield, visual flow (fast/slow, sputtering).
4. **Taste**: Evaluate against target (e.g., balanced, sweet, no sour/bitter).
5. **Adjust based on symptoms**:

   | Symptom | Cause | Fix |
   |---------|-------|-----|
   | Too fast (<25s), sour | Under-extracted | Grind finer, increase dose |
   | Too slow (>35s), bitter | Over-extracted | Grind coarser, decrease dose |
   | Right time but sour | Not enough extraction | Grind finer |
   | Right time but bitter | Too much extraction | Grind coarser |
   | Channeling, inconsistent | Distribution issue | Use WDT, level, tap |

6. **Repeat**: Pull next shot with adjustment. Taste. Continue until dialed.
7. **Lock in**: Record grind setting, dose, yield, time as dialed recipe.
8. **Re-dial when**: Coffee changes (new batch, different roast date, origin change).

**Tools:** Refractometer (for TDS/extraction %), shot timer, dose scale (0.1g precision), tamper.

### Workflow 4: Cupping Session (SCA Protocol)

**Objective:** Evaluate multiple coffees in a standardized format.

**Steps:**

1. **Prep**: Set up cupping table. Grind each sample to SCA standard (8.25g : 150ml). Label blind (code only).
2. **Grind & smell**: Grind each, note fragrance/aroma dry.
3. **Pour**: 200°F water to 150ml mark on each cup. Start timer.
4. **Steep**: At 4:00, break crust with spoon. Push grounds back, skim foam.
5. **Slurp**: At 4:30, begin slurping from spoon. Cup each at 5:00, 8:00, 12:00+.
6. **Score**: Use SCA form. Assign scores for each attribute.
7. **Calculate**: Sum attributes + subtract defects = total score.
8. **Compare**: Tabulate scores. Note top performers and why.
9. **Re-taste**: With water to reset palate. Final ranking.
10. **Document**: Record observations, scores, and recommendations.

**Tools:** SCA cupping form, cupping bowls, spoons, grinder, kettle, timer, hot water source.

### Workflow 5: Menu Costing & Pricing

**Objective:** Calculate food cost and set menu prices for cafe drinks.

**Steps:**

1. **Determine recipe**: List ingredients, quantities per drink.
2. **Calculate ingredient cost**: Using purchase price per unit. Example: espresso shot uses 18g coffee. At $15/lb green, and 12% roast loss, coffee cost = $15/lb × 1.12 / 453.6g × 18g = $0.67.
3. **Sum costs**: Add all ingredients (milk, syrup, cup, lid, straw).
4. **Apply food cost target**: Divide ingredient cost by target food cost %. If target FC% = 30%, menu price = cost / 0.30.
5. **Test price**: Compare to market. Adjust if needed (competition, positioning).
6. **Document**: Recipe card with cost breakdown and target price.
7. **Re-price quarterly**: Recalculate as ingredient prices change.

**Tools:** Spreadsheet (cost calculator), POS system (for actual cost tracking), recipe management software.

## Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Buying on price alone**: Lowest cost green often means compromise on quality or consistency. Specialty is premium for a reason.

2. **Skipping pre-ship approval**: Without sample approval clause, you accept whatever arrives. Insist on approval.

3. **Underestimating lead time**: Specialty coffee can take 4–8+ weeks from order to arrival. Plan inventory accordingly.

4. **Cupping incorrectly**: Rushing the steep, not breaking crust properly, or slurping too quietly misses key aromatics. Follow protocol.

5. **Roast profile too hot**: Pushing too hard damages delicate origin character. Heat is a tool, not a goal.

6. **Dial-in without measuring**: Eyeballing extraction leads to inconsistency. Use scale, timer, refractometer.

7. **Ignoring degassing**: Brewing coffee too fresh (under 24hrs post-roast) causes poor extraction and off-gassing flavors. Rest before brewing.

8. **Over-roasting to hide defects**: Using very dark roast to mask mediocre green. Proper roasting showcases quality.

9. **FIFO failure**: Older coffee in front of newer. Rotate stock properly to prevent staleness.

10. **Contract without QC clause**: Always include pre-ship sample approval or arrival QC rejection clause.

11. **Underpricing drinks**: Menu prices should reflect quality. Calculate real costs including labor, rent, overhead.

12. **Ignoring regulatory changes**: FDA FSMA compliance is not optional for food businesses. Stay current.

13. **Scaling before testing**: Don't commit to large orders of new origin without cupping multiple samples.

14. **Shipping speed vs cost**: Air freight is 5–10x faster but 3–5x more expensive. Weight cost against cash flow.

15. **All-in-one contracts**: Avoid contracts with no escape clause if QC fails on arrival.
